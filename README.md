# SLS Marketing Tech Test

## Notes

I have followed the design specification as best as I possibly could. I have unit tested the components with 100% 
code coverage.

Should I have more time I would like to have done integration and UI tests along with the unit tests

A few points to note:

- Not all the design spec Typography matches the given Typography, in this case I have used the font and weight in the design spec rather than best match with the 5 given Typographies
- Not all the required images for the design spec where given in the icons section, I have stripped out the missing ones I have noticed from the spec and used them.
- Sometimes some of the broker images have a faint thin black lines around them, this appears to be a problem with the actual images when I have exported them from Figma
